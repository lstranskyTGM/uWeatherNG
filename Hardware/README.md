The hardware case for all the components of the uWeather project was designed in Fusion 360 and printed with an Original Prusa i3 MK3S+ 3D-printer. There are 3 parts in total. The top in which all the sensors and an OLED Display is mounted. The middle part functions as an seperation and on the bottom attached is the ESP32 and a circuit board with the Powerbank underneath it. 

The Prototyp was printed using a PETG filament, this makes everything waterproof, UV-proof and resistant to the weather. 

Everything is mounted with 4 screws.  

The Rain Sensor is directly glued on the exterior of the case. Except the light sensor and the OLED Display that have a plexiglass cover. 

Air vents are also used to prevent misinterpretation of the BME280 Sensor.

Cable connections are realized with dupont connectors.

# ToDo:

- [x] ~~Simple and compact design~~
- [x] ~~Water resistant~~
- [x] ~~uWeather Logo~~

## Possible Extensions:

- [ ] More screws to hold the heavy powerbank
