# ESP32

## Test Scripts

In the test scripts all functions for the ESP32 are tested seperately. This makes it easier to find errors and debug everything.   

## Main Script

The ESP32 script initiates by setting up various sensors and modules, including GPS, and collecting environmental data. It then attempts to transmit this information via MQTT over an LTE connection. If the connection is established, the collected data is published to a designated topic on an MQTT broker. After transmission, the ESP32 enters a deep sleep mode to conserve energy, periodically waking to update and resend data. Throughout this process, all status updates and messages are displayed both on the Serial Monitor and an OLED display. This configuration ensures continuous, efficient monitoring of environmental conditions with minimal human intervention.

## Sensor / Module List

### GY-302 BH1750 Light Sensor Module

The GY-302 BH1750 Photoresistor module is used to measure light intensity. The resistance will decrease in the presence of light and increase in the absence of it. 

**Light Intensity:** lux

### GY-SGP30 Air Quality Sensor [I2C]

THe GY-SGP30 is a digital air quality sensor that measures the amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air. The sensor also measures the equivalent carbon-dioxide (eCO2) concentration.
It uses the I2C bus to communicate with the ESP32.

**Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC):** ppb

**Equivalent Carbon-dioxide (eCO2):** ppm
